# Product: Go Echo Modular Monolith Template

## Product Purpose
A production-ready Go backend template that provides developers with a clean, performant foundation for building modular monolith applications using the Echo framework. This template bridges the gap between rapid development and production-ready architecture.

## Problem Statement
Developers face challenges when starting new Go backend projects:
- Balancing speed of development with clean architecture principles
- Needing a template that can scale from simple APIs to complex domain-driven applications
- Requiring production-ready features like authentication, database integration, and proper error handling
- Wanting clear separation of concerns while maintaining developer productivity

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Backend Developers**: Go developers building REST APIs and microservices
- **Technical Leads**: Architects designing new backend systems
- **Startup Teams**: Small teams needing scalable foundation quickly

### Secondary Users
- **Full-stack Developers**: Learning Go backend development
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deploying Go applications in production
- **Enterprise Developers**: Creating modular monoliths that can evolve to microservices

## User Goals

### Immediate Goals
- Bootstrap a new Go backend project in minutes, not hours
- Have working authentication, database, and API documentation out of the box
- Follow Go best practices and clean architecture from day one
- Deploy to production with confidence and proper tooling

### Long-term Goals
- Scale from monolith to microservices when needed
- Maintain high code quality and testability
- Onboard new team members quickly with clear structure
- Build maintainable systems with clear domain boundaries

## User Workflows

### New Project Setup Workflow
1. Clone/initialize the template
2. Configure environment variables and database
3. Run database migrations
4. Start development server
5. Begin implementing first domain/feature

### Domain Development Workflow
1. Create domain directory structure
2. Write SQL queries and generate Go code with sqlc
3. Implement domain interfaces and business logic
4. Add HTTP handlers with Swagger documentation
5. Write comprehensive tests with generated mocks

### Production Deployment Workflow
1. Configure production environment
2. Run database migrations
3. Build and containerize application
4. Deploy with proper monitoring and logging
5. Monitor health and performance metrics
