# Product Definition: template-go-echo

## Problem Statement
Developers building microservices in Go often face a choice between building from scratch (time-consuming, error-prone) or using heavyweight frameworks (unnecessary complexity). There is a gap for a lightweight, well-structured template that provides production-ready patterns without over-engineering.

## Product Vision
**template-go-echo** is a reference implementation and starting point for Go microservices that demonstrates:
- Clean Architecture principles applied to Go
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) organizational patterns
- Production-ready infrastructure (logging, configuration, error handling)
- Best practices for testability, security, and performance
- Seamless developer experience with minimal onboarding time

## User Personas

### 1. **Senior Backend Developer** (Primary)
- Building new microservices from scratch
- Wants proven patterns and architecture
- Values code organization and maintainability
- Needs high-performance foundation
- **Goals:**
  - Start with solid architecture foundation
  - Reduce time to first API endpoint
  - Maintain consistent patterns across projects
- **Pain Points:**
  - Repetitive boilerplate setup
  - Inconsistent architecture decisions
  - Difficulty scaling team understanding

### 2. **Tech Lead / Architect** (Secondary)
- Establishing company-wide service patterns
- Teaching architecture to team
- Need flexibility to customize
- **Goals:**
  - Define standard structure for team services
  - Document design decisions (ADRs)
  - Enable quick onboarding of new developers
- **Pain Points:**
  - No standardized starting point
  - Difficulty enforcing patterns
  - Architecture inconsistency across services

### 3. **Startup Founder / MVP Builder** (Secondary)
- Rapid development with quality assurance
- Limited resources, need quick time-to-market
- Growth from MVP to scalable service
- **Goals:**
  - Launch product quickly
  - Build with patterns that won't limit growth
  - Minimize technical debt
- **Pain Points:**
  - Over-engineering delays launch
  - Under-engineering causes refactoring debt
  - Limited time for learning framework nuances

## Value Propositions

### For Developers
- **Rapid Setup:** Start building API endpoints in minutes, not days
- **Clear Structure:** Organized, predictable layout makes navigation intuitive
- **Proven Patterns:** Clean Architecture and DDD reduce architectural debates
- **Testability:** Structure encourages unit testing and mocking from the start
- **Learning Resource:** Understand best practices through well-documented code

### For Teams
- **Consistency:** Standard structure across all services
- **Onboarding:** New team members understand architecture quickly
- **Maintenance:** Clear separation of concerns reduces bugs
- **Scalability:** Structure supports growth from monolith to microservices

### For Organizations
- **Time-to-Value:** Reduce project startup time by 50%+
- **Code Quality:** Built-in linting, testing patterns, security practices
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple database backends (SQL, NoSQL, Cache)
- **Future-Proof:** Architecture supports evolution without major rewrites

## Key User Workflows

### 1. **Initialize New Service**
- Clone template
- Configure environment
- Create first domain module
- Deploy API with health checks

### 2. **Add New Feature**
- Write SQL queries
- Generate type-safe code with sqlc
- Implement handler, usecase, repository
- Generate mocks, write tests
- Auto-generate Swagger docs

### 3. **Scale Service**
- Add new domain modules independently
- Connect to different database backends
- Configure for horizontal scaling
- Add middleware and advanced features

## Success Metrics

### Developer Metrics
- Time from clone to first deployed endpoint: < 15 minutes
- Time to implement new feature (simple): < 30 minutes
- Code coverage: > 80% across all layers
- Linting compliance: 100% pass rate

### Quality Metrics
- Security: 0 known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Performance: < 50ms P95 latency for simple queries
- Reliability: Support graceful shutdown, health checks
- Documentation: 100% of public APIs documented

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of services built from template
- Team adoption rate
- Community contributions and feedback
- Fork count and stars (if open source)

## UX Goals

### Developer Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear file organization, predictable naming
- **Fast Feedback Loop:** Quick compilation, instant error messages
- **Helpful Errors:** Structured logging and error messages
- **Documentation:** Code comments, examples, API docs

### API Users
- **Consistency:** Predictable request/response format (JSend)
- **Clarity:** Well-documented endpoints, clear error messages
- **Reliability:** Consistent error codes, proper status codes
- **Performance:** Fast responses, no unnecessary latency
