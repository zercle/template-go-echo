## 📊 Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Linting | ✓ PASS | 0 issues (golangci-lint v2) |
| Tests | ✓ PASS | All passing with race detection |
| Build | ✓ PASS | Binary size: 11M (production) |
| Coverage | ✓ READY | Framework in place for tracking |
| Security | ✓ PASS | No vulnerabilities found |
| Performance | ✓ GOOD | Connection pooling enabled |

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# Run final quality checks
make quality

# Generate test coverage
make test-coverage

# Build production image
make docker-build
```

### 2. Configuration

Set environment variables:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)  # CHANGE THIS!
export DB_DSN=user:password@tcp(prod-db:3306)/appname
export SERVER_DEBUG=false
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations on production database
migrate -path sql/migrations -database "$MIGRATION_DSN" up
```

### 4. Deployment Options

**Option A: Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option B: Kubernetes**
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

**Option C: Traditional Server**
```bash
./template-go-echo &
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check readiness
curl http://localhost:8080/ready

# Check liveness
curl http://localhost:8080/live
```

## 📈 Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Set up centralized logging
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- [ ] Set up metrics collection (Prometheus)
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical issues
- [ ] Set up health check monitoring
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling rules
- [ ] Set up backup strategy

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default JWT secret
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS in production
- [ ] Enable WAF (if available)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Database encryption at rest
- [ ] Secure API key management
- [ ] Rate limiting per endpoint

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly:**
- Monitor error logs
- Check system performance
- Review security alerts

**Monthly:**
- Update dependencies
- Review and optimize slow queries
- Audit access logs

**Quarterly:**
- Full security audit
- Load testing
- Disaster recovery drill

### Update Procedure

```bash
# Update dependencies
go get -u ./...

# Run tests
make test

# Deploy updated code
make docker-build
docker push registry/app:latest
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

1. Check environment variables
2. Verify database connection
3. Check port availability
4. Review logs: `docker logs container-name`

### Database Connection Issues

1. Verify database is running
2. Check connection string format
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Check credentials

### High Memory Usage

1. Monitor goroutine count
2. Check connection pool size
3. Review request handling
4. Profile memory usage: `go tool pprof`
